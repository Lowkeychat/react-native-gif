## Props
### `style`
ImageResizeMode is an Enum for different image resizing modes, set via the `resizeMode` style property on Image components. For now the values are `contain` and `cover`. Please make an issue if any other (`stretch`, `center`, `repeat`) is needed.

| Type  | Required |
| ---------------- |:----------------:|
| ViewStyle      | false     |

### `resizeMode`
Determines how to resize the image when the frame doesn't match the raw image dimensions. Defaults to `cover` as a standard react-native's Image component.

* `cover`: Scale the image uniformly (maintain the image's aspect ratio) so that both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal to or larger than the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding).
* `contain`: Scale the image uniformly (maintain the image's aspect ratio) so that both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal to or less than the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding).

Please make a Github issue if any other (`stretch`, `center`, `repeat`) is needed.

| Type  | Required |
| ---------------- |:----------------:|
| enum('cover', 'contain')      | false     |

### `source`
The image source (either a remote URL or a local file resource).

| Type  | Required |
| ---------------- |:----------------:|
| ImageSourcePropType      | true     |
